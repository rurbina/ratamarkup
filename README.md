Ratamarkup
----------

Ratamarkup is yet another simple markup language. It's extensible, which means you can easily write blocks that can be invoked from a document. Those blocks are parsed by your own php function. That means you can achieve a lot while keeping the core language simple.

It takes some ideas from Ward's wiki and from MediaWiki, and adds some of its own.
